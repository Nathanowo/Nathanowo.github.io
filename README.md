### So what is a Fixed-geared bike or some call it Fixie?
#Fixed-geared bike is a bicycle that has drivestrain, with no freewheel mechanism, meaning you have to keep pedaling or else your feet well be drag by the pedal itself, the fixie has been developed way back the 1980's, it is commonly used in indoor races in a dome called a Velodrome.

###How do I skid?
#Skidding is typically the deceleration method for brakeless fixed-gears. To skid, move your weight forward on the bike and lock your legs to get the tire to slide on the ground. This will help you come to a stop quickly. There are many types of skid namelyy a few are Hop Skid, Whip skid, Long Skid.
