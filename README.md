#Is it yourfirst time riding a Fixie or a fixed-geared bike? Then I am here to show you the most frequently asked questions by beginners on how and what should I do when beginning to ride a Fixie!

### So what is a Fixed-geared bike or some call it Fixie?
#Fixed-geared bike is a bicycle that has drivestrain, with no freewheel mechanism, meaning you have to keep pedaling or else your feet well be drag by the pedal itself, the fixie has been developed way back the 1980's, it is commonly used in indoor races in a dome called a Velodrome.

###How do I get started riding it? 
#Firstly you need to get used to riding it without the freewheel mechanism, after you overcome that it's easy as riding a normal freewheel bike, after that you need to learn a trick which is called skiding it is a very basic fundamental if you are going to ride a fixie with no brakes, skiding is mainly to stop or slow down your momentum while riding.

###How do I skid?
#Skidding is typically the deceleration method for brakeless fixed-gears. To skid, move your weight forward on the bike and lock your legs to get the tire to slide on the ground. This will help you come to a stop quickly. There are many types of skid namelyy a few are Hop Skid, Whip skid, Long Skid.

###Now that you have learned the basic now we will goon to Bikeparts if wheter togo expensive or just decently cheap.

##A frame is the body of the bike, always maintain it in tiptop shape in order to save you from future expenses. There are lots of frames that can play a good role on how you ride, frames can be divided to 3 mainly Carbon, Alloy, Chromium. These varies in weight with Carbon being the lightest and the Alloyand and Chromium in an almost similarities.
